				<h3>Readers' Stories</h3>
				<p>Many invited me to their church or their civic group to share the message of believing in ourselves and in something bigger. In each city, I met people trusting their own whispers and Doing Good. Some dreams were as big as a building and others were making a difference one life at a time. Meeting these inspiring people and finding out was calling them is part of my next chapter. Here are a few of the many I have met. If you know someone who has listened to their whisper to find their calling let me know about it. Email me their (or your) photo and story: <a href="mailto:kathy.izard@me.com?subject:Readers Stories" class="button lblue">Email Kathy</a></p>

					<h3>Caroline Bundy</h3>
					<h6>Birmingham, AL</h6>
					<p class="story-line">As Development Director for AIDS Alabama, Caroline has a day job. 
But she could not shake the idea that what she needed to be 
working on was a shelter for homeless and runaway youth 
to protect them from being caught up in sex-trafficking or other 
dangers of the streets. When we met at Canterbury 
United Methodist, I felt like she was at the beginning
of the exact same journey I had just been through with 
Moore Place. Caroline is now listening to her whisper and 
developing a community plan for a shelter 
for at-risk youth near the city-center of Birmingham.

					<h3>Caroline Hart </h3>
					<h6>Crossnore, NC</h6>
					<p class="story-line">I have received a lot of emails since publishing 
but none like Caroline’s. She wrote, “I've been hearing the whisper
 for some time, but afraid to listen - it's 
scary, daunting and will change my life forever.” 
That whisper? To adopt a sibling set of four children
to add to their family of one son.  She added:
“It's not hundreds of homeless, but I sure hope by
 loving these four as our own, we will change the 
trajectory of their precious lives.”
The Hart adoption will be final in 2018
 taking their family from three to seven!

					<h3>Caroline Chambre Hammock</h3>
					<h6>Kankan, Guinea</h6>
					<p class="story-line">You might recognize Caroline’s name from the book
as the first director of Moore Place. Caroline was with UMC 
until last year when she kept hearing whispers about 
returning to West Africa where she had once worked
 for the Peace Corps. Caroline tells me that reading my book amplified 
those whispers so she finally listened. Caroline is on a six-month 
assignment for the World Food Programme in Guinea.

					<p class="story-line">Rachel shared my book in her little free library
and Melissa was one of the early readers.
After many email exchanges, we finally met in 
March 2017 when Rachel invited me to speak at 
Canterbury United Methodist Church.
Rachel is a FORCE for good, leading her church’s
mission and outreach, creating a social justice book club for
kids, mom to her own daughters and oh yeah, 
just started a doctoral program!

					<h6>Charleston, SC</h6>
					<p class="story-line">Gigi and I met at her church’s Advent luncheon 
organized by Chase Wood for St. Philips Episcopal Church. 
Gigi helped sell books at the luncheon but then asked 
if she could sell them in her store in Charleston, Rhodes Boutique. 
Gigi has now sold well over one hundred copies of 
The Hundred Story Home and as far as I know is the 
only dress store retailer in the country selling my book!

					<p class="story-line">A friend in my book club, Ann Temple couldn’t wait to 
tell me about her last haircut. She sat down with her hairstylist, 
Mike, and he said, “You have got to read this book!”
It was The Hundred Story Home. Mike and I had never met, 
but he had been lending out copies to all his customers. 
When I went to meet him and thank him, he asked if I was 
going to write another book. I told him the Moore Place 
miracle was all I had to tell right now and he said, 
“Well, make something up—I want to read more!”
Thanks, Mike—working on some more nonfiction!

					<h6>Fort Mill, SC</h6>
					<p class="story-line">I had never met Kathy when she emailed to see 
if I would speak at her church South Mecklenburg 
Presbyterian in South Charlotte. I would soon find out 
what a “doer” she is not only holding discussion groups 
about The Hundred Story Home but also organizing a 
large speaking event which raised enough for 150 gift cards to 
make the holidays bright for Moore Place residents.
And she introduced me to her identical twin sister in Austin, Texas.

					<p class="story-line">If Peggy reminds you of someone in another 
reader story—you are right. Peggy and Kathy Paquette are identical
twins and both are church librarians. After speaking at her sister’s church, 
Peggy invited me to Austin for an incredible gathering in her home.
Her friends not only raised over $600 that night
for Moore Place, Peggy presented me with a special
glass jar with “Moore Place Fund” inscribed on it
for future events.

The Hundred Story Home, “I think we could have talked all
day about you, homeless issues, mental health issues…and more.”
They decided to share the message so Beth invited me to
speak at Centenary United Methodist Church. Over 150 people
 came and with great marketing by <strong>Rosemary Pulliam</strong>, 
they sold almost two hundred books! If I had a Beth and Rosemary
in every city, this book would hit the NY Times best seller list!

					<p class="story-line">When Marilyn invited me to come speak to her 
book club the BiblioBabes, she wrote that they had been together 
for more than twenty years. And then she wrote that Eugene Coleman 
had done odd jobs for them for years but the Taylors had moved 
and lost track of Coleman and worried something had happened. 
Then Marilyn wrote: “When I read about him in your book, I woke up
 my husband, shouting, "I found Eugene Coleman!”
The Taylors have reconnected and took Coleman to lunch.

					<h6>West Chester, PA</h6>
					<p class="story-line">Eliza and I met in a God-instance that probably takes 
a whole chapter of another book to explain! But she invited me 
 to Christ Church Christiana Hundred in Wilmington, Delaware. 
Along with over a hundred church members, services providers 
came to kickoff the church’s new partnership with Family Promise
 to shelter homeless families. I also got to meet <strong>Lynne Jenson</strong>
Minister for Youth and Children who gave a copy of 
The Hundred Story Home to every staff member in their preschool!

I will always appreciate her faith in me! The event was for her ECW

Dozens of women came to celebrate the season and

she said that since I had extended the same type of invitation to
Ron and Denver, she was hoping I would accept—and I did!
I was honored to be a part of the kickoff for this dynamic group of women
launching their first book club meeting by reading and
discussing The Hundred Story Home. Beth wrote 
“I've given the book to ministers at my church, friends involved in our 
Atlanta community and members of other books clubs.
Thanks Beth, Ruth and Sandra for introducing my book to Atlanta!

Then told me several book clubs wanted to join. 
And finally wrote she was moving my talk to 
St Michael’s Episcopal Church where the church hall 
was packed with her friends and some of my 
North Carolina cousins! Martha’s enthusiasm 
was contagious and I will be headed back to 
Raleigh for another talk this year.
Martha is amazing!

a women’s dinner and to speak with their Prayers in the Park 
group which ministers to the homeless in Greensboro.
Only after the incredible sold-out dinner 
did I find out that Knox has a great business baking and 
delivering these amazing coffee cakes with fresh flowers—
which I now order and send as my go-to gift. 
And that Prayers in the Park team is now thinking 
about moving from a park ministry to something bigger.
Stay tuned!

book brought us together. An avid fitness instructor and runner, 
Kristan had to find a whole new way to live after a catastrophic
 illness struck in 2013. After 100 days, Kristan survived a 
medically-induced coma but awoke to realize she was now 
a triple amputee. Today, Kristan is a mother 
of five children, counselor, motivational speaker and blogger. 
And I can’t wait for her to finish her book!

her aunt in Buffalo, New York. This particular book was found on
a window sill in a Tai Chi Studio in Buffalo and Meg
thought she was following the instructions on the inside cover 
which she assumed was written by me. 
Except, I have no idea how that book got to Buffalo
or who wrote that note. Meg and I are now fast friends and
I have been to her new book club where the 
very first book they read was 
The Hundred Story Home. But it also turns out Meg 
is a talented coach, and I needed some coaching!

ago back when I was working with her brother, Bill Holt, 
raising money for Moore Place. He was the $3 million man 
in the book and his sister is no less remarkable. But we only 
connected after Elizabeth invited me to 
First Presbyterian Church Greensboro and then to
The Reviewers—a century old book club! Wheels are now

at an advertising agency. When she reached out after reading
 the book, I was surprised to learn Ana had changed careers completely 
and was working at one of Charlotte’s largest 
catholic churches, St Gabriel, as the Pastoral Care Director. 
Ana invited me to speak twice, once about
The Moore Place story and then, about Finding Your Calling.
The conversations sparked by these talks have led this parish
 to study how they can advocate for affordable housing
 in meaningful ways and they have even recently intervened on 
behalf of a homeless young man who became hospitalized
after a senseless beating on the streets.

her friend had given her. Inside was the note her friend had written
to her saying that my story reminded her of Melinda’s and
encouraging her to listen for her whisper.
Melinda was also a graphic designer and mom, looking for 
purpose after a recent struggle with the death of her parents.
Melinda shared at the book signing that my book, and listening
led her to start a new career with a housing nonprofit 
in Guilford County
