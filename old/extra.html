				<p><strong>Compelling and convicting</strong>, The Hundred Story Home is a powerful testament to the way one person can affect transformation at the deepest levels. Kathy’s beautiful storytelling propelled me outside of my comfort zones. . . <strong>It’s impossible to read The Hundred Story Home and walk away unchanged.</strong>&quot;</p>

				<p>Kathy has written <strong>one of the most inspirational books I’ve ever read</strong>. She weaves her incredible storytelling with authenticity and humility to the page unlike any other. Kathy is one of those rare people who see a need in their communities and do something about it. This book might just cause you to step out and do something that you’ve never done before for the benefit of someone else.&quot;</p>

				<p>I LOVE The Hundred Story Home. Kathy Izard is a beautiful writer who has woven her personal life story into an account of her heroic effort to help the homeless. In her book of midlife discovery, she writes not only about creating a community for one hundred homeless adults but also <strong>inspires others to do so much more than what they ever thought possible.</strong>&quot;</p>

				<p>This is <strong>a powerful story, skillfully told, and one that will hold you</strong>. As you read about a remarkable woman who gave up a promising career to do what for her was totally unexpected—to build a home for the homeless—you may find it is also a bridge to faith for you. As it has been for her.&quot;</p>

				<p>In The Hundred Story Home, Kathy Izard so beautifully and eloquently manages what we all wish we could—capturing her life story in a transparent and authentic way. Through the narrative of her life, we see Kathy’s triumphs, struggles, and ultimate commitment to something bigger than herself: the call to help those less fortunate. Kathy is <strong>a storyteller, philanthropist, and courageous writer throughout these pages and in her life.</strong>&quot;</p>

				<p>From the beginning of time, I believe it was ordained that Kathy would have a life changing encounter with Denver Moore. He believed that as well. These unexpected encounters . . .thrill believers and encourage doubters to search. Prepare yourself to be thrilled or to begin searching for your Denver.&quot;</p>

				<p>The Hundred Story Home is a captivating, beautifully-written account of one woman's search for purpose and how a combination of doubt, faith and doing the right thing a thousand times over led to the building of something important and extraordinary.&quot;</p>

				<p>Kathy Izard tells two compelling stories in one: About her journey toward fulfilling her life's purpose and about Charlotte's journey to finally treating its chronically homeless with compassion and dignity.  Each has twists and turns, each has a happy ending, and Izard tells each with a style that will captivate readers far beyond her most natural audience.&quot;</p>

				<p>Kathy Izard, the remarkable and unlikely champion of housing for the homeless in Charlotte, gives us another gift – her honest, humble and unforgettable story of the chance encounters and enduring comments that conceived and sustained Moore Place despite repeated setbacks. &quot;</p>
